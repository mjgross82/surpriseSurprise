                    This year was off to a pretty rough start for me. It's a long story, but my girlfriend Taina (who I recently moved in with) and I were hardly able to spend any time together at all, and I was absolutely miserable at Target. When you called me up out of the blue back in July, I swear to God I thought I was dreaming. After you offered me the job, I was walking around in a daze. I'd catch myself getting totally lost in my head, staring off into space, with a huge grin on my face. Then the transition to work from home was harder than I expected and the isolation started to take it's toll on me. Well, Taina and I were finally able to work things out and I have moved in with her and her teenage daughter, Nina. Nina can be a little slow to warm up to new people (like me lol), but her and I get along really well and I am so happy to be a part of their family. Between the two of them, and you and SolQ, this has been by far and without a doubt the best year of my life. These last couple of weeks I've been so happy I feel like I am finally waking up, and I hope you have noticed that things are finally starting to click for me and I think next year I'm really going to hit the ground running. I don't think I can ever thank you enough for this opportunity. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me. We hope you have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
